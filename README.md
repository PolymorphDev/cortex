# Cortex
Cortex is a WordPress plugin that eases the process of creating pages using blocks.

## What's a block ?

A block is a reusable piece of code that can be inserted in a page. The block structure is stored within the `blocks` folder of your theme. It's made from a block definition file `block.json`, a block template file `block.twig` a block preview file `preview.twig` and a file that contains the fields `fields.json`. The folder may also have a stylesheet file and script file that is included when the block is required.

### Licence
Cortex is free to use for development and production during the beta period. However, a licence will need to be purchased on production sites once the project goes out of beta.
